This is Aerial, a single page, single screen responsive site template. Real simple. Makes heavy use of CSS animation (something I've been messing with a lot lately). Should work well as a landing page that just directs folks to your stuff elsewhere. 

The scrolling background was derived from "Icefields" by Ryan Schroeder, a talented photographer from Vancouver who graciously released it on Unsplash under the CC0 license. Be sure to check out his other stuff over at flickr (link below) as well as all the other kickass CC0-licensed images at Unsplash (unsplash.com).


The Scrolling Background:

	This relies entirely on CSS to do its thing, which is cool, but that makes changing it a bit weird/tricky at first. You can still use pretty much any image you want, but for best results make sure yours is:

	- Horizontally tileable.
	- Wide and short.
	- About 1500px wide.
